## Debugging & Logs

- The application writes logs and memory usage info to `app_debug.log` in the project directory.
- Check this file for errors, export status, and memory usage trends.
- Memory usage is logged every 60 seconds while the app is running.

- If you experience high memory usage or crashes, review `app_debug.log` for details.
- Make sure `app_debug.log` is listed in your `.gitignore` to avoid committing log files to version control.
