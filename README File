- Place your Google Sheets `credentials.json` in this folder if using Google Sheets export.
- All data is stored in `inventory.db` (SQLite).
- Uploaded images and QR codes are in the `static/` folder.

---

## Debugging & Logs

- The application writes logs and memory usage info to `app_debug.log` in the project directory.
- Check this file for errors, export status, and memory usage trends.
- Memory usage is logged every 60 seconds while the app is running.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you experience high memory usage or crashes, review `app_debug.log` for details.
- Make sure `app_debug.log` and `.env` are listed in your `.gitignore` to avoid committing log files and secrets to version control.
